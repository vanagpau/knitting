A knitted shoe for her 8’ clown was the beginning of my knitting life (oh, and a golf club for her amazing guitar man and a pebble for her equally fabulous waterfall butterfly machine-knitted wall hanging). She was an extra-ordinary knitter. Her Indian grandmother taught her to knit.  My mother was inspirational. She later went on to set-up a textile design training centre in London called Newsight Ltd (with charitable status). Newsight Ltd was given, by a Bill of Parliament, the name The British School of Knitting. I became a director of the now dormant company just before she died in 2017. ",More than 3 years.,I crochet once a month.,Not applicable.,NA,Not applicable.,"Safe, It feels like home in my hands. Joy - ... delight and calm. I love designing mostly - creating delicious things...    Knitting is skilled work, slow art, measured and precise; special.    Design makes ideas tangible; it takes abstract thoughts and inspirations and makes something concrete. I think through making things; new ideas becoming real. Since materials (yarn and fibre chiefly) and their untold qualities; tactile, soft, bouncy, alive etc., are what we encounter, you could say that our sensory domain is and has been moulded by material interaction. So working with yarn and fibre is a thoroughly rich-knowledge-and-experience-based-experiential domain that taps into other forms of intellect, memory, intuition etc..    Before we can create or design, we need to investigate, communicate, attempt, discover, play, question, challenge, and do. Mostly knit and unravel - bollocksey. ;0) - The more of our mental ability we bring into ‘the doing’ the deeper and more enriching the experience.    I think that’s why we like to make things.  I think that's why I like to design knit things.","Mini Bio :  ? Ruth Morris ran a knitting group at her house. Once a week we’d sit around Ruth’s large wooden kitchen table (in winter the wood burner chucked out the most desirable heat), talking about life, knitting, illness and love; we drank copious amounts of tea and ate delicious home-made cakes that Ruth seemed to create magically in seconds. Attending this group propelled me to design and promote hand-knitting. They supported my dream ideas beyond practical. The input, advice and constructive criticism these fabulous people have given me on designing, yarn colours, branding has been invaluable. Ruth and I sang in a choir together and while traveling to and from the practice we imagined a knitting show full of performance and cake. So we set up a fibre trade show with cabaret called Knit Expo. We hosted three events and then as our design/yarn biz Ruth and Belinda was growing we decided to call it a day to hosting. Belinda Harris-Reid design life/yarn business came out of this collaboration. Ruth had deeper commitments to family and so she went to knead dough and look after her extensive delicious family and I went on to acquire a big spin of British wool and continue to design in undyed yarn. *  *Undyed  - no colour… natural colours; muted shaded. The texture, motifs and constructions pops out when colour is not in the equation. Keep it simple. Keep is smart. Let it flow. Let it drape and envelope around women’s bodies; seamless – one size fits all. (Fat is a feminist issue ;0)    (– The transition from the world of performance to working with fibre came about from a chance encounter with another hand-knit-wear designer. After hosting a Devon based yarn, fibre, knitting trade event; the big KNIT show  (2010 and 2011), and realising that our collaboration bore fruit we joined forces and formed a hand-knit design company.   Last year Ruth (co-founder) decided to concentrate of just designing and her family commitments and I went on to form my own luxury hand-knit design company.     What followed was unplanned but, looking back, appears pre-ordained and has exposed my love of designing beautifully constructed knitwear/housewear that is delicious to wear/own, some would say transformative and of course utterly comfortable.)    Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury. Coco Chanel     I also run The Knitting Hotel - we host 25+ retreat in Dawlish, Devon each year -     Women coming together ot share out love of fibre and ... Well we chat...about women learning together, family and life,  loss, travelling and new adventures, shapes and sizing, racism and antisemitism, mixed heritage and grandchildren, we speak about menopause and period pains, about losing people we love (too soon), we laugh about presents and weird and wonderful relatives. We watch Strictly with a critical eye. 💃🏻 🕺. We speak about reading the end of books before the beginning and watching the end of films before the beginning.  We speak about politics, trade unions and travel, adventures, ‘people like us’, privilege and cohesion, ageing and energy, recycling and making presents, about excess and family and too much and not enough, about wars, about Judaism and moving on from hated, about projects still in the cupboard and plying yarn and making our own fibre, about origins of yarn and spinning wheels, about looking after budgies, about living 4 houses away from you partner, we spoke about magnetic eyelashes.... and La De Da, ....    We speak about adapting patterns and retirement and working for a Bishop, working in mental health, working in the NHS and care system, working at Bath Spa Uni, being a nun, studying for a degree in theology, working as a sorter of ‘stuff’ for hospice care charity shops, performance and travelling around in camper vans, owning a shop, training teachers to teach effectively, oh ... and we make stitch markers ....so much.    2 women have left their abusive husbands after coming to stay with us.

I started though because I had seen someone knitting in a cafe and I craved to be like them - they appeared calm, confident, sociable, but above all so incredibly joyous and expressive and artistic in the colours and scale of what they were knitting. They had dispelled all my associated preconceptions about knitting and I wanted so very much to have a go too. My experience was not at all like that though. I would often stay up for hours at night losing sleep time, neglecting self care, just knitting quietly. Sometimes thoughts of the day banging around in my head as I grappled with my emotions. But increasingly just the rhythm or repetitiveness of the stitch patterns, hour by hour. I would seek out more complex stitch patterns that demanded more focus and quiet. I joined a knit group which was difficult for me and taking part made me feel nauseously anxious even though they were all very relaxed and free. I tried to go every week but often didn't make it out of the house. By going along and participating and observing though, I slowly realised that the person I was was coming out through my acts of making and if I wanted to feel freer and and confident and express joy and creativity in what I was what I was knitting I had to be a better person. It took knitting and all its frustrations to help me to realise this. I tried to respect and treat knitting as work assigning an importance to it. I made simple plans, a budget, organised my kit and donated the excess to charity, kept simple notes. I also stood and looked at myself in the mirror more as I dared to imagine knitting things for myself. I loathed my body image and when I first knitted things for myself I wouldn't wear them and I continued to abandon unfinished garments feeling guilty and disappointed with myself. I couldn't stop actively knitting though and kept trying new patterns and techniques that absorbed my mind and dissolved other unhealthy thoughts. I began to feel generally calmer when knitting and I was driven to achieve those moments of minor accomplishments and a sense of pride, learning to accept mistakes too, in what I'd journeyed to make. I have now made garments and worn them, but sometimes there is still a long gap in finishing a garment and feeling confident and proud to be seen in it. The fact that I made them has become more value to me than how I look. I have knitted garments for others too and for charities, and that makes me feel more connected and aware of other peoples feelings as well as my own as I slowly knit for them. At the moment I have not knitted for a month because of extenuating work schedules and I didn't feel like I needed to knit at the start of the month. I have noticed I'm struggling emotionally though and there is little else that I currently do that demands calm and similar attentiveness whilst actively creating something with my hands and mind. ","I knit for the purpose and process of making something lovely and/or useful, of learning something new or repeating and refining something, of having something to do whilst I'm alone, of being able to connect with someone else either as a recipient of my knitting or occasionally as a companion knitter sharing thoughts and ideas or just giving space to one another.

For example: Socks can be knit with double pointed, needles (DPNs), magic loop, small circumference needles, or two circular needles. You can knit them cuff-down or toe-up, try a variety of heels and toe patterns, apply texture (lace, cables, etc.), and use a variety of yarns (self-striping, self-patterning, solid, variegated, They can be very simple (a vanilla sock) or complicated (Cookie A's patterns come to mind).

I do it most days after work and it is usually the first thing I do when I get up at weekends. I rarely do it without doing something else at the same time - watching TV or podcasts or listening to the radio. I feel lots of different things when I knit depending on what the project is and how I am feeling at the time. I get a lot of pleasure and satisfaction and a sense of achievement out of the act of making something tangible but that often goes hand in hand with tension and frustration if I encounter difficulties with a project. I enjoy the problem solving of knitting but I have to be in the right frame of mind for knitting. However, I'm not much of a 'mindless' knitter - I don't enjoy a project that doesn't have texture or interest or that will challenge me in some way. When I am not knitting I like to think about things I would like to knit and why. Knitting gives me the mental space for creativity.","I knit things I want to wear but I also knit things that I want to make - things I think I will find pleasure the process of making, things that will teach me a new technique or stitch texture. I originally began knitting because I wanted to take a step back from the culture of fast fashion and since then my pleasure in the knowledge of textile materials, their production and environmental impact has grown. I feel knitting also connects me to lost family members who knitted which, as someone with a very small family, has a strong emotional resonance for me. I prefer to knit things mainly for myself but will occasionally knit things for close friends and family. I think that is because I select the things I knit regardless of who they are for based on them using processes and textures I will enjoy knitting and I want to have the output around me in order to remain connected to the memory of the process.

I almost always knit to make gifts for friends and family - I feel things I have knitted are really special gifts that I can weave a lot of love into and they come to symbolise a degree of devotion to that person and that relationship, because I put a lot of time and commitment into making them an item.
